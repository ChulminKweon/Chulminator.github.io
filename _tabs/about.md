My name is **Chulmin Kweon**, and I have a genuine passion for programming. I have a broad interest in various programming aspects, but I specialize in **physical simulation**, particularly in the areas of **finite element method** and **material point method**. Additionally, I have gained some valuable experience in **machine learning** and **artificial intelligence**. Recently, I have delved into the exciting world of **game development** and have been acquiring knowledge in this field.
