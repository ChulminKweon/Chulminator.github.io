Before we dive in, I want to clarify that my knowledge of Jekyll and Ruby is at a beginner level. I primarily use them for website creation purposes. Jekyll is a static website generator using the Ruby programming language. We need to utilize them because they are essential for crafting static websites hosted on GitHub Pages.

## Downloading Ruby and Jekyll
You can obtain Ruby from https://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/. Personally, I opted for rubyinstaller-devkit-3.3.0-1-x64. The installation process is straightforward. Once completed, you'll find the "Start Command Prompt with Ruby." In the prompt, enter the following commands:

```ruby
 gem install jekyll bundler 
 gem install webrick

 jekyll new ./
```
{: file='Start Command Prompt with Ruby'}

## Conclusion

As mentioned, my understanding of Ruby and Jekyll is basic. The good news is you don't need an in-depth knowledge of them to create a GitHub website. Now, we're prepared to embark on crafting your personal webpage beyond the standard "hello world!".
